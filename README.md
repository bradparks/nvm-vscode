# NVM and Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

This repository is an example of how to use NVM with Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode). For more details see the [companion blog post](https://www.seafish.io/blog/nvm-and-vs-code/).

Open this project up using VS Code and run it - you might need to `chmod +x node.sh` to have the script be executable. You'll see that VS code will run the project using the version of node in the `.nvmrc` file.
